          </br>
          <p>This application is designed so you can keep you bike fully maintained and safe to use on the
            UK roads. Find information about the different parts of a bike such as the brakes or handlebars
            and how you can service and repair them. Also included is a maintance routine which allows you to record
            different tasks that you have done so you never forget.
